# Byron v0.8a1.dev57 *"Don Juan"*

Byron is a source code [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) designed to support assembly or higher level languages. It starts by generating a set of random programs, which are then iteratively improved by an [evolutionary algorithm](https://cad-polito-it.github.io/byron/evolution). Internally, it encodes candidate solutions as [typed](https://rcor.me/papers/typed-graph-theory.pdf), [directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Directed_graph) [multigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph), and can effectively handle complex, realistic structures containing local and global variables, conditional and looping statements, and subroutines.

Programs can be evaluated using a user-defined Python function or an external tool, such as an interpreter or a simulator. Different types of parallelization are supported out of the box, from simple multithreading to the creation of temporary directories where multiple subprocesses are concurrently [spawned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(computing)).

Byron, formerly known as [MicroGP](https://github.com/microgp) v4, was made possible by the contributions of [many individuals](contributors) over [many years](history).
