> Build on [MicroGP](https://cad-polito-it.github.io/byron/history) technology

Byron is a source code [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) designed to support assembly and high-level languages. It starts by generating a set of random programs, which are then iteratively improved by an [evolutionary algorithm](https://cad-polito-it.github.io/byron/evolution). Internally, it encodes candidate solutions as [typed](https://rcor.me/papers/typed-graph-theory.pdf), [directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Directed_graph) [multigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph), and can effectively handle complex, realistic structures containing local and global variables, conditional and looping statements, and subroutines.

Programs can be evaluated using a user-defined Python function or an external tool, such as an interpreter or a simulator. Different types of parallelization are supported out of the box, from simple multithreading to the creation of temporary directories where multiple subprocesses are concurrently [spawned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(computing)).

:package: The Python package is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/byron/); this repo is only useful if you want to hack the code.

### TL;DR

* Byron is currently in [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) and under active
  development
* The default branch is always the more stable
* Do not clone experimental branches `exp/*` unless you really know what you are doing
* Follow this [style guide](https://github.com/squillero/style/blob/master/python.md) and keep the code formatted
  with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/)
* Follow this [convention](https://github.com/squillero/style/blob/master/git.md) when drafting commit messages
* Write as few lines of code and as many lines of comments as possible (ie. use builtins, exploit generators and list
  comprehension)
* Be [paranoid](https://cad-polito-it.github.io/byron/paranoia) (cit. *"I need someone to show me the things"*)
* Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for unit testing (ie. `coverage run --module pytest --all`)
* Use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/) for linting and [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking
* Use [direnv](https://direnv.net) to patch environment variables
* It may be wise to contact [Giovanni](https://github.com/squillero) before trying to change anything
